# EPG data for USA local channels in XMLTV format

This includes all ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC affiliates. I may eventually add the CW, Telemundo, Univision, and Unimas, and possibly even major independent stations, though I make no promises. I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of this data or the timeliness of updates. I expect to upload new data on Tuesdays and Fridays, but sometimes stuff happens.

If you see any problems or something is broken, please open an issue and I'll look into it.

This git operates under the rules put forth in the Three Midnight Amendments:
1. Be Cool
2. C'mon
3. Nice
